# LeafletBlazor

# Description

LeafletBlazor is a wapper for leafletjs for Blazor both server and wasm.  This wrapper was inspired from <a href="https://github.com/Mehigh17/BlazorLeaflet/">BlazorLeaflet</a> and aims to bring the API more complete and also inline with the javascript API.

# Notes
Currently we have no plans to include any methods or events where in the leafletjs documentation that states that its called only internally (example see createTile on TileLayer).  If you have a specific need for one of those methods/events, please feel free to open an issue 
to bring up why you need that method/event exposed and after discussion if it is still warrented, we will add it into the library.  

# Progress
The progress and also state of what has been added/upcoming has been added to the <a href="https://github.com/jeffreyladd/LeafletBlazor/projects/1">project board</a>.  The items in To do are in order of when they will be started.  

# Installation
