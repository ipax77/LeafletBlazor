# LeafletBlazor

# Description

LeafletBlazor is a wapper for leafletjs for Blazor both server and wasm.  This wrapper was inspired from <a href="https://github.com/Mehigh17/BlazorLeaflet/">BlazorLeaflet</a> and aims to bring the API more complete and also inline with the javascript API.

# Installation

This section will be updated once as we get closer to releasing this onto nuget.

The `master` branch is used as the development branch for the time being till we get closer to release.  When that happens, this section will change.
